This is a backfill note from 2019-07-28. The idea is, what are mathematical achievements that are useful for motivating the study of mathematics?

# Motivating problems in math

## Solved and important!
- Infinite number of primes
- Sqrt(2) is irrational
- Fundamental theorem of algebra (1806)
- Unsolvability of the quintic (1824)
- Three construction problems of antiquity (1837, 1837, 1882)
- e and pi are transcendental (1873, 1882)
- Public-key cryptography (Diffie-Hellman-Merkle, RSA, elliptic curves) (1973-1976)
- Fermat’s Last Theorem / modularity theorem (1994, 2001)
- Poincare Conjecture (2003)
- Classification of finite simple groups (2004)

## Axiomatics
- Parallel Postulate (1829-1868)
- Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems (1931)
- Continuum Hypothesis (1940, 1963)

## Solved and unimportant, but with an interesting anecdote
- Hilbert’s 3rd Problem (Dehn Invariants, 1883-1900, first to be solved)
- Four color theorem (1976)
- Kepler conjecture and honeycomb conjecture (1998, 1999, Thomas Hales)

## Unsolved
- Goldbach Conjecture
- Twin prime conjecture
- Perfect numbers / Mersenne primes
- Collatz Conjecture
- Whether Euler-Mascheroni constant is rational / algebraic or not
- Riemann Hypothesis
- Ramsey numbers (R(5, 5), R(6, 6))
- ABC Conjecture
- Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture
