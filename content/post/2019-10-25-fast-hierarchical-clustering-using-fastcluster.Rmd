Do you use hierarchical clustering packages like R's [`hclust`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/hclust.html) or Python's [`scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage.html#scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage) in your workflow? If so, you're using an $O(N^3)$ algorithm^[Where $N$ is the number of data points being clustered, obviously.] and should switch to the [`fastcluster`](http://danifold.net/fastcluster.html) package, which provides $O(N^2)$ routines for the most commonly used types of clustering.

`fastcluster` is implemented in C++, with interfaces for [C++](https://lionel.kr.hs-niederrhein.de/~dalitz/data/hclust/), [R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fastcluster/index.html), and [Python](https://pypi.org/project/fastcluster/). In particular, the Python interface mirrors `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage`, and the R interface mirrors `stats::hclust` and `flashClust::flashClust`, so switching over is a no-brainer. Do it!

For a performance comparison provided by the package's author, take a look [here](http://danifold.net/fastcluster.html?section=1). `fastcluster` is described in a Journal of Statistical Software [publication](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v053i09) from 2013, with algorithmic details in a [2011 arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.2378). The key algorithms used to get to $O(N^2)$ are a variant of Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees and the [nearest-neighbor chain algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest-neighbor_chain_algorithm). Note that centroid and median linkage still take $O(N^3)$ time with this package.

I haven't read the details of these algorithms yet, but if they are correct, then the Wikipedia articles on [hierarchical clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering) and [UPGMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPGMA) (average linkage clustering) could use an update^[As of October 2019.].
