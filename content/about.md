I started this blog in my first year as a Statistics PhD Student at the University of Oxford. You can find more about me at [my home page](https://www.brianczhang.com/).

This website was built using <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown</a> on top of <a href="https://github.com/vividvilla/ezhil">Ezhil theme</a>. All files used to generate this website can be found at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/brianzhang01/blog_source).
