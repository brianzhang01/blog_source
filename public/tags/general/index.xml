      <description>Hi there, and thanks for stopping by! In this post, I briefly introduce my current ideas for this blog and say a bit about myself.
As of September, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a first-year PhD student at Oxford&amp;rsquo;s Statistics department. I received my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s in Physics from Harvard in 2015, and after working for two years am excited to be back in an academic setting. Part of this transition means more freedom and a lot more self-structured learning time.</description>
